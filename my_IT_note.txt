rm -rf .git/

that's the fucking problem:
django-heroku==0.3.1


 .gitignore:
 ll_env/
__pycache__/
*.sqlite3
.DS_Store


We tell Git to ignore the entire ll_env directory, because we can re-create 
it automatically at any time. We also don’t track the __pycache__ directory, 
which contains the .pyc files that are created automatically when the .py files 
are executed. We don’t track changes to the local database, because it’s a 
bad habit: if you’re ever using SQLite on a server, you might accidentally 
overwrite the live database with your local test database when you push the 
project to the server. The asterisk in *.sqlite3 tells Git to ignore any file that 
ends with the extension .sqlite3.


If you’re using macOS, add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file. This is a file that 
stores information about folder settings on macOS, and it has nothing to do with this 
project.

The overall structure of our app will be:
- the Django runs the backend server and exposes an API. Hosted on PythonAnywhere.
- the React frontend calls the API and renders the user interface on the client ’ s browser. Hosted on Netlify.


1, 
With Django, we can already create a complete web application. So why
bother to create an API with Django and then create separate
frontends when we can do it all with Django? Now, say your app
becomes a hit. Users love your app so much that they want an iOS and
Android version of it. So, you have to create the same functionality
of your app in two more different languages (Swift and Kotlin for
example). You might also hear of new frontend frameworks like React,
Angular, Vue to make your app more dynamic and modern. You want to
try them out. How can we better achieve both objectives? The answer
is to create a REST API. With Django REST Framework, we can create a
common API to serve information to different frontends like Vue,
React, Android, iOS etc. We need only to create the logic in the API
and then have each of the frontends connect to it. This makes it more
scalable and reliable since we just have one code base and database
to serve the information.

2, 
The Django Rest Framework (DRF) library enables us to easily create
Django APIs that return JSON. DRF takes care of the heavy lifting of
transforming database models into a RESTful API. For example, it
provides CRUD operations, authentication modules, JSON serializers,
routing, and many more. It purposefully mimics many of Django ’ s
traditional conventions making it much faster to learn. With a
minimal amount of code, DRF can transform any existing Django
application into a web API.


3, 
Python is widely used all over the world to build automations,
machine learning models, data analysis, and web development. It can
help you build automations for day-to-day work tasks, create web
applications, perform data analysis, and build machine learning
models.



4, serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from some_app.models import SomeModel

serializers.ModelSerializer
ModelSerializer provides an API to create serializers
from your models.
