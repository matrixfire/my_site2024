rm -rf .git/

that's the fucking problem:
django-heroku==0.3.1


 .gitignore:
 ll_env/
__pycache__/
*.sqlite3
.DS_Store


We tell Git to ignore the entire ll_env directory, because we can re-create 
it automatically at any time. We also don’t track the __pycache__ directory, 
which contains the .pyc files that are created automatically when the .py files 
are executed. We don’t track changes to the local database, because it’s a 
bad habit: if you’re ever using SQLite on a server, you might accidentally 
overwrite the live database with your local test database when you push the 
project to the server. The asterisk in *.sqlite3 tells Git to ignore any file that 
ends with the extension .sqlite3.


If you’re using macOS, add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file. This is a file that 
stores information about folder settings on macOS, and it has nothing to do with this 
project.
